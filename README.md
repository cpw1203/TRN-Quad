# Planetary Lander Quadcopter with Terrain-Relative Navigation

## Overview
This repository contains the work for our **2026 Senior Design Project**, which aims to design and implement an **autonomous quadcopter that simulates a planetary lander**.  
The system performs **autonomous descent, hazard avoidance, and precision landing** using **terrain-relative navigation (TRN)** driven by **vision-based navigation (VBN)**.  

Our approach integrates **control theory, estimation algorithms, and vision-based navigation** within a simulation-to-deployment workflow. Control and state-estimation algorithms are developed in **MATLAB/Simulink**, validated in **ROS 2 + Gazebo simulation**, and deployed to the quadcopter‚Äôs flight controller via auto-generated embedded code.
